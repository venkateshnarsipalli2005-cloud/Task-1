# Processed Data

This directory contains engineered features and processed datasets.

## Files

### engineered_features.csv
- Generated by: `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`
- Contains: 50+ time series features
- Format: CSV with date and sales columns plus all engineered features
- Size: Larger than raw data (includes feature columns)

## Usage

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load engineered features
df = pd.read_csv('engineered_features.csv')

# Ready for modeling
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = df.drop(['date', 'sales'], axis=1)
y = df['sales']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```

## Generated Files

- `engineered_features.csv` - Time series features for modeling
- (Other processed datasets added as needed)

See `/outputs/` folder for final results and exports.
